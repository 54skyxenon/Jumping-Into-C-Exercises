# Jumping Into C++ Exercises

This repository hosts all of my original solutions to the exercises of Alex Allain's <i> <a href="https://www.cprogramming.com/c++book/">Jumping Into C++</a> </i>. These were the first programs I wrote, and it took a solid two and a half years to work through the entire book. I highly recommend Alex's book for complete beginners looking for a strong foundation.

This repository is organized by chapters, and each chapter contains project folders for each problem. You will find the actual code in `main.cpp`. Other files exist because of CodeBlocks's project environment.
